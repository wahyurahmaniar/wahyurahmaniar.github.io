intro: |
  <p style="font-size:15px;">
  Currently I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT), Taiwan and teach artificial intelligence (AI) online class at Sekolah Tinggi Teknologi Bandung (STTB). I received the B.S. degree in Electronics and Instrumentation from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM), Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2009 and Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from National Central University (NCU), Taiwan, in 2020. 
  My research interests are in the areas of robotics, computer vision, image processing, and AI. <br/><br/>
  
  The research I conducted in the field of computer vision and image processing, including AI. I used C++ or Python programming on Windows or Linux operating systems. Overall, I have at least 10 years experience in programming. And for the AI field, I have studied it since I took a Ph.D. degree until now for about 7 years.
  For intelligent systems, I focus more on developing algorithms or frameworks that can run systems in the real-time in the actual environment. Besides, I also understand well enough the theory and mathematics for these systems, including machine learning and deep learning. One of my interests in AI research is that I want to create my own network or method. 
  I have also been a reviewer in several journals, such as Circuit World, Sensor Review, Journal of Robotics and Control, Journal of Electronic Imaging, Sensors (MDPI), BDCC (MDPI), and Scientific Reports (Nature). <br/><br/>
  
  My friends call me Wahyu, Wayau, Ayu, or Ayuchan.<br/><br/>
